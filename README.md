## This theme is made with Vencord in mind because it takes advantage of it's ability to make Discord translucent on macOS

### You can enable translucency by doing as follows:

* Go to Settings > Vencord, then toggle "Enable Translucent Window".

 * You can adjust the oppacity and colors by pasting & messing with this varriables in QuickCSS

.theme-dark {
  --background-tertiary: #2f31364b;
}

```
